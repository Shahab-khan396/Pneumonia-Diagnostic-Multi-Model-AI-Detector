Pneumonia Diagnostic Hub: Multi-Model AI DetectorAn end-to-end medical imaging web application that leverages state-of-the-art Deep Learning architectures to detect Pneumonia from Chest X-Ray images. This project demonstrates the power of Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning using four major models: VGG19, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0.🚀 FeaturesMulti-Model Integration: Choose between 4 different AI architectures for diagnosis.High Precision Fine-Tuning: Uses specialized "unfrozen" layers to identify subtle medical textures.Real-time Prediction: Instant classification (Normal vs. Pneumonia) with confidence percentages.Dynamic Web UI: Built with Flask and Bootstrap 5 for a clean, responsive medical interface. Project ArchitectureThe project follows a standard deep learning pipeline:Preprocessing: X-rays are resized to $128 \times 128$ and converted to 3-channel RGB.Base Models: Pre-trained weights from ImageNet provide the visual foundation.Custom Head: Flatten/Pooling layers followed by Dense layers $(4608 \rightarrow 1152 \rightarrow 2)$ for classification.Deployment: A Flask API serves the models and handles image uploads.📂 Directory Structure🛠️ Setup & Installation1.

Run the ApplicationVisit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser to start diagnosing!📊 Model Performance ComparisonBased on our training history, here is the performance breakdown:🧠 How it Works (Fine-Tuning Logic)Instead of training from scratch, we "unfreeze" specific deep layers (e.g., block5_conv3 in VGG19). This allows the model to adjust its existing visual filters to recognize specific medical markers like pulmonary infiltrates and pleural effusions.$$Loss = -\sum_{c=1}^M y_{o,c} \log(p_{o,c})$$We use the Categorical Cross-Entropy loss function above to minimize the error between the AI's guess ($p$) and the actual diagnosis ($y$).⚠️ DisclaimerThis tool is for educational and research purposes only.
